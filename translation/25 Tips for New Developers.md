# 自学程序员给新手的25个建议
# 25 Tips for New Developers: Advice from a (Mostly) Self-Taught Software Engineer

博客读者经常向我提问，对于程序员新手你有什么建议？因此，我觉得是时候记录自己对此的想法了  
The most common question I get from blog readers is "What is your advice for new programmers?" So, I thought it was time to write up my thoughts.

将来我会详细写下自己的成长经历。大学时候我修读了2门计算机科学课程，然后不久之后就获得了一个软件工程实习工作。我开始了网站开发的生涯，最初从事后端开发，后来转岗前端开发。大学期间我并没有修读网站开发相关课程，因此，网站开发技能是我自学的。  
I will write up my full story in the future, but I took two computer science classes in college. Then, I got a software engineering internship shortly after. I started doing web development work, initially on the backend and then eventually on the frontend. My college definitely did not teach web development, let alone within the first few computer science classes, so I taught myself.

我并不认为自己的学习经历是特有的，所有的程序员都有某种程度的自学经历。不管是完全从头学起还是修读了计算机科学专业学位，他们都有过自学正则表达式的经历。实际上，自学是开发者需要掌握的最重要的技能。  
I don't think my story is unique -- all programmers are self-taught to some degree, whether that's fully self-taught or that they have a masters in computer science, but they taught themselves RegEx along the way. In fact, self-teaching may be one of the most important skills you can have as a developer.

除了以上描述的经历，我的主要工作是教人写代码，同时作为志愿者为一些组织工作。因此，这篇文章描述的建议同样来自这些经历。  
In addition to my own experience, I also teach people to code as my primary job and for organizations I volunteer with -- so this article is drawing on that experience as well.

以下内容开始展述我对程序员新手的建议。
The rest of this article will have my tips for started.

# 给新手程序员的建议
# My Tips for New Programmers

1. 找到从事编程工作的原因，并牢记它  
1. Have your reason, and remember it  

如果你打算开始自己的编程生涯，那么你需要寻找一个动机。这个动机可能是你喜欢写代码，想获取更多的薪水，或者你希望利用编程能够提高正在从事的大量Excel处理工作更加高效。牢记那个动机，因为坚持编程是很难的，坚持的过程肯定会遇到很多挫折。为了克服那些挫折，牢记那个动机会显得格外重要。你可以使用便利贴记录下来贴在电脑主屏幕上面，或者像我一样使用白板笔写到镜子上面。
If you want to start programming, there has to be a reason for that. Whether its that you love writing code, you want to have a more lucrative career, or that you are doing a bunch of Excel work and you want to make that more efficient. Keep track of that reason; programming is hard, and you will get frustrated sometimes. It will be essential to keep that reason in mind to stick with it. You could put a sticky note on your computer, a note on your home screen, or (like me) write it on your mirror with a dry erase marker.

2. 打好数学基础  
2. Build a solid foundation

这可能是一条特殊的建议，但是我认为它真的很重要。在开始编程之前，如果你有段时间没有学习过数学知识了，我建议从代数开始温习。大多数编程概念源自代数，比如函数和变量。理解那些编程之外的概念对于将来的学习有很大帮助。我推荐是Khan Academy的代数课程。
This may be a unique piece of advice, but I think its really helpful. Before you start writing code, if you haven't looked at math in a while, I would revisit the concepts from Algebra 1. Most of programming is built on algebra 1 math -- i.e., functions and variables. Understanding these concepts outside of programming will be super valuable in the future. I recommend Khan Academy's Algebra 1 course!

3. 寻找一个编程社区  
3. Find a community

另外一个很有帮助的建议是找到一个编程社区，这个社区有助于你学习编程。这个社区价值很高，因为社区的其他人跟你一样在学习编程，他们会推荐给你各种学习资源，你们还可以互相鼓励。强烈建议加入一个所在领域的线下研讨会，即使是小的城市也往往可以在附近找的到。如果实在找不到，推荐dev.to和CodeNewbie这2个优秀的在线社区网站。CodeNewbie社区拥有Twitter聊天室（每周一个话题），一个Slack模块和一个播客模块。Dev.to社区有很多技术博客，阅读的同时可以向博主提问。 
Another thing that will be really helpful is finding a community to support you as you start writing code. This community will be valuable because other people will be in the same place as you, offer resources that helped them, and offer encouragement. I would suggest finding a meetup in your area as the top solution here, even small cities tend to have a group somewhat nearby. If there isn't one, I would suggest dev.to and the CodeNewbie community as two excellent alternatives. CodeNewbie has a weekly Twitter chat, a Slack group, and podcasts to listen to. Dev.to has a bunch of blog posts and a #discuss tag where you can post your questions!

4. 善于分解问题  
4. Break down problems into smaller ones

编程需要掌握的一项很重要的技能，是将困难的问题分解成更小的问题直到每个分解出来的小问题都能够被解决。如果你对着编辑器无从下手，很可能是因为还没有充分的将问题分解。  
One of the most important parts of programming is taking a large problem and breaking it into smaller and smaller pieces until those pieces are solvable. If you are looking at a blank text editor not knowing where to start, it may be because you haven't broken down the problem enough!

5. 伪代码  
5. Pseudocode

本条建议与前面一条有关，很多时候在开始写代码之前先尝试将代码步骤尽可能详细的写下来是很有帮助的。这个实现步骤就是伪代码，你可以用任意形式记录下来。先进行理论分析，思考甚至写下每个用于解决问题的步骤，这对于解决问题有很有帮助。  
Related to the previous point, a lot of times it is beneficial to write down in detail what you are trying to do in plain words before even trying to write code. This process is called pseudocoding, and it can take whatever form you want it to. It can also be helpful to solve a problem really slowly on paper first, thinking about or even writing down the individual steps you are taking to solve that problem.

6. 接受周期学习规律  
6. Embrace the cycle of learning

如果你正在把编程作为第二职业进行学习，特别是如果你已经离开校园有段时间了，学会怎么去学习将会花费你很多精力。学习的过程中有很多起伏是正常现象，第一步就是接受过山车式的学习规律。  
If you're learning to code as a second career, especially if you've been away from the classroom for a while, learning how to learn is going to be a big part of your process. There are lots of ups and downs involved, which is very natural! I would brace yourself for that rollercoaster before starting out.

7. 从免费资源入手  
7. Start with free resources

现在可以找到大量的编程学习资料。其中一部分是免费的，另外一部分不是。我建议选择免费资源进行入门，确认喜欢编程后，你会考虑学习付费资料甚至参加培训班。这里是我总结的最喜欢的免费编程学习资料。  
There are a million and one resources for learning how to code. Some are free, and some are paid. I would start with the free resources, make sure you like writing code, and then after that, you could think about moving onto paid resources or even a bootcamp. I have an article about my favorite free learn to code resources here.

8. 寻找编程方向
8. Find your niche

编程方面有很多方向，寻找你喜欢的那个并坚持下去。不建议努力去学习8种编程语言，前端和后端，编译和解释性语言，以及所有的文本编辑器和开发者工具等等。找到那些你真的感兴趣的并掌握这些技能。  
There are a lot of worlds within programming, find one world that you love and focus on that. Instead of trying to learn 8 programming languages, frontend and backend, compiled and interpreted languages, all the text editors and developer tools, etc. Find a few things you are really interested in and get good at them.

9. 掌握模式识别  
9. Get good at pattern recognition

模式识别是编程学习中最需要掌握的技能。当别人讨论以“DRY”（Don't Repeat Yourself）方式进行编程的时候，他们是在建议精简代码。对于模式识别的学习我推荐Set这个游戏，你甚至可以每天在纽约时报的官网上练习。
Recognizing patterns in code is one of the most important skills you can have. When people talk about writing "DRY" code (i.e., Don't Repeat Yourself) they are talking about reducing the patterns in your code. I recommend the game Set for pattern recognition -- you can even play online each day on the New York Times' website!

10. 尽早培养好的编码习惯  
10. Make good habits early

如果早期已经养成好的编码习惯，写出简介的代码会变的很简单。坏习惯很难被改掉，这里是几个有助于写出简介代码的建议。如果你正在从事网站开发工作，运行代码中的HEML和CSS验证器有助于精确发现修改点。  
It will be easier to write clean code in the future if you get into the habit early. Bad habits can be hard to break. Here are my tips for writing cleaner code. If you are doing web development, running HTML and CSS validators on your code can tell you exactly what to fix!

11. 认清自己的学习风格  
11. Identify your learning style

每个人有不同的学习方式，不管你是一个喜欢看视频的视觉型学习者，并且需要别人督促学习，或者喜欢看文档，你需要认清与别人的最大的区别是什么。识别出来最好的学习方式，然后选择适合这个方式的学习资源。比如，阅读文档和其中的代码示例能够使我收获最多，因此我对学习指南不感兴趣。  
Everybody learns differently -- whether that means you are a visual learner, love videos, need somebody to push you, or you love documentation, you will learn best differently than the person next to you. Identify how you learn best, and rely on resources that fit that style well. For example, I learn best from reading documentation and code examples from that documentation, and I lose focus easily in tutorials.

12. 坚持，但是不要太固执
12. Struggle, but not too much

学习的过程中适当的坚持很重要，这会帮助你独自解决问题或者从手头的资料找到答案。虽然这么说，在一个问题上面挣扎太久会变得让你变得低效和沮丧。尝试几个小时后问题还没有解决就需要向别人寻求帮助了。  
Struggling a little bit when you are learning is really important so that you can solve the problem yourself and find an answer using resources that exist. That being said, it can become unproductive and demotivating to struggle with a problem for too long. After a few hours, reach out to someone for help!

13. 习惯失败  
13. Get comfortable with failure

编程是很难的事情，正确的答案不容易直接找到。我的编程生涯最重要的一个时刻是解决编写数独游戏的一次失败。能够接受程序中存在一些能够看得到的问题是很有挑战的，但是这是编程过程很重要的一部分。  
Programming is hard, and finding the right answer won't be immediate. One of the most pivotal moments in my programming journey was failing at writing a Sudoku solver. It can be challenging to adjust to not getting everything right away and seeing those error messages, but that is a huge part of programming.

14. 喜欢错误提示  
14. Love your error messages

错误提示超级有用，但是当你初次看到标红报错信息时候可能会觉得恐怖。读懂报错信息，然后根据这些报错信息解决问题是很大的进步。实际上你会明白，一个程序默默的崩溃远比看到一个有用的报错信息烦人。  
Error messages are super helpful, but when you are starting out that red error message can be terrifying! One huge step to take is to read through those messages, understand them, and then use them to solve the problem. In fact, you will get to a point where a program silently failing will be far more annoying than a useful error message!

15. 一些编程语言更易学  
15. Some programming languages are easier than others

第一个编程语言学习哪个没有标准答案，然而一些语言的确更容易学习。我认为最易学的三种语言是Python，Ruby和JavaScript，因为它们都有强大的社区支撑，有更直接的语法规则，并且都是解释执行，因此不需要进行编译执行。  
There isn't a right answer for what programming language to learn first; however, some will be easier to pick up. My top three are Python, Ruby, and JavaScript because all three have a large community behind them, have more straightforward syntax, and are interpreted, so you don't need to go through a compiling process.

16. 没必要样样精通  
16. You don't need to know everything

关于编程知识不可能都搞懂的，没有人能够掌握所有的编程语言，每一条语句，每一个库或者框架，或者每个问题的最佳解决方案。不要为了掌握所有编程知识而烦恼，聚焦在你确实明白的知识点然后慢慢扩展。  
It is straight up 100% impossible to know everything about programming. Nobody knows every programming language, every single method that's out there, every library and framework, or the perfect solution to every problem. Don't worry about learning everything, just focus on what you do know and extending that.

17. 深入学习优于泛泛而学  
17. Depth over Breadth

深入钻研一个知识点，要比每个知识点都学一点皮毛好很多，尤其是入门学习的时候。深入学习的知识会刻印在你的心里，这使得下一步的学习更轻松。心无旁骛，不要轻易放弃正在学习的知识转向新的领域。  
Learning one thing in depth is better than learning a tiny bit about a lot of things, especially at first. That in-depth knowledge will carry over and make learning that next thing easier. Put the blinders on, so you don't get tempted to drop what you're learning and move to something new.

18. 注重基础的学习  
18. Focus on the fundamentals first

编程的基础很重要，因为编程的方方面面都需要。在学习热门的看起来令人生畏的库之前，注意掌握循环、条件语句、函数、数据类型和面向编程思想的概念。如果已经掌握了这些基础概念，学习代码库会变得简单很多。并且编程语言间的概念是相通的，因此你只需要搞懂其中一门语言，随后学习其他语言只需要注意语法层面的区别。  
The fundamentals of programming are invaluable, and you will use them no matter what you end up doing with programming. Focus on having a solid knowledge of loops, conditionals, functions, data types, and (in most languages) object-oriented programming before moving on to learning about that awesome library that everyone's talking about. It will be so much easier to learn that library once you know the fundamentals really well. They will also carry over from language to language, so you only have to really learn them once -- after that it's just syntax!

19. 擅长解决问题  
19. Get good at Problem-solving

解决问题的能力是编程学习的基础，能够更高效解决问题很重要。找到突破口，手写伪代码，然后分解问题对于解决问题确实很有帮助。有时候我发现一些新晋开发者更像是在研究问题而不是解决问题，如果利用Google搜索足够多的相关内容，他们很快就能够找到一个解决办法。的确，Google和Stack Overflow超级有用，但是有时候也要坚持自己的想法。开始搜索之前先多用几种方式尝试一下，或者首先搜索子问题，比如，搜索“JavaScript语言中如何将字符串转换为数组”，而不是“JavaScript语言中如何翻转字符串”。  
Problem-solving is the basis behind programming! Getting better at this is critical. Solving riddles, writing code on paper, and breaking down problems can really help with problem-solving. Something I sometimes see with new developers is that they approach programming like a research problem instead of a problem-solving project -- if they Google something well enough, then they'll have a solution. Yes, Google and Stack Overflow are super helpful, but rely on yourself sometimes too. Try something out a few different ways before researching it. Or, research small parts of the problem instead of the problem itself -- i.e. "turn a String into an array JavaScript" instead of "reverse string JavaScript."

20. 擅长做研究  
20. Get good at researching

最值得学习的，是如何发现问题的答案，或者感兴趣的学习语言或者库的新特性。学会使用Google，加入社区，以及订阅资源很重要。我经常使用的Google搜索模板是“问题 语言/框架/库”，尽量使用较少的字，并且不要加过滤。例如，"数组排序 JavaScript", "元素旋转 CSS", 或者 "创建路由 Vue."  
One of the biggest things to learn is how to find good answers to your questions or to learn new features of your language or library. Using Google is important, so is joining communities and subscribing to resources. The Google template I normally use is "problem language/framework/library" in as few words as possible and without filler. So, "sort array JavaScript", "spin element CSS", or "create router Vue."

21. 构架自己喜欢的项目  
21. Build projects you love

学习的过程中，你将会构建各种工程用来练习。挑选感兴趣的工程，你讲话更乐于花更多时间完成这个工程。构建一个完善的工程，比创建一堆半成品更让人激动。  
When you're learning, you will be building various projects to practice (and show off) your skills. Pick project ideas that are interesting to you; you will be much more likely to finish them and want to put work into them. Related, complete those projects. A few really good finished projects is way more impressive than a bunch of half-finished ones!

22. 只与自己做比较  
22. Compare yourself to only yourself

身边有很多人在学习编程。不要攀比学习进度，只与之前的自己做对比，侧重观察自己的成长。  
There are a lot of people learning to code out there. Don't compare your progress to someone else's, instead compare yourself to previous you and focus on your own growth.

23. 挑战更多编程难题  
23. Do a bunch of code challenges

挑战难题对于巩固基础很有帮助，同时也有助于锻炼解决问题的能力和面试练习。每天我都会在Twitter使用#CodingPuzzle标签推送一个难题，大家都可以尝试去寻找解决办法。  
Doing quick code challenges can really help solidify the fundamentals. They are great for problem-solving and practicing for interviews. I post one on Twitter every day with the hashtag #CodingPuzzle if you want someone else to solve them with!

24. 庆祝获取的成就  
24. Celebrate your wins

编程学习是很难的事情，因此当你完成了一件事，即使很微小，庆祝吧！我在Google Keep上面记录自己的成就，每当遇到不顺利的时候，我会回头重温那些成就。  
Learning to program can be a really difficult process, so when you accomplish something, even if its small, celebrate it! I keep track of my wins in Google Keep so, if I have a bad day, I can come back to those wins and remember them!

25. 编程是了不起的事情  
25. Programming is awesome

编程是一件很酷，因为你在构建事物。我时常记起桑迪.梅斯的名言：  
Programming is really cool because you get to build things. I always come back to this Sandi Metz quote:

那些写代码的人们是如此的幸运。编写代码是一种纯粹的快乐，因为我们在使用创造性的能量完成任务。我们已经安排好了自己的生活，我们可以享受使用自己掌握的知识编写代码。我们创造重要的事物，我们是现代手工艺人，构建现实的世界，正如砖匠和桥梁建筑者，我们对自己的成就感到自豪。  
Those of us whose work is to write software are incredibly lucky. Building software is a guiltless pleasure because we get to use our creative energy to get things done. We have arranged our lives to have it both ways; we can enjoy the pure act of writing code in sure knowledge that the code we write has use. We produce things that matter. We are modern craftspeople, building structures that make up present-day reality, and no less than bricklayers or bridge builders, we take justifiable pride in our accomplishments.

这应该被所有编程者共享，不管是激情满满的新手还是满脸厌倦的前辈，不管是工作在不起眼的初创公司还是老牌的企业，我们都尽力做好自己的工作，期望做的工作是价值的，同时希望工作的过程是充满乐趣的。  
This all programmers share, from the most enthusiastic newbie to the apparently jaded elder, whether working at the lightest weight Internet startup or the most staid, long-entrenched enterprise. We want to do our best work. We want our work to have meaning. We want to have fun along the way.
